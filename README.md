# [My personal page](http://grigorov.live)
A personal page where I put information about myself, my background and my projects.

## Architecture
The page is a frontend only JS ui that is fed information from firebase and other APIs. This allows the app to display up to date data without modification to the code.

## Technology
The app is built on React and Redux. It is deployed on "Heroku" and all the static data is hosted on firebase.
